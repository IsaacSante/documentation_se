## Lights Setup

### Hue Lights
Connect all Hue Lights to power and turn them on. If the lights have a cover wait until the end of the setup process to cover them. We will need a six digit serial number written on each light to add them to the Hue App. 

Make sure the lights are **Phillips Hue full spectrum lights**. Phillips has other lights that only change within the white spectrum and smart lights that are not compatible with the Hue App such as the Wiz App lights.


### HomeBridge
Connect the HomeBridge to power and press the on button in the middle. 

### Hue App
Connect your phone to our router WiFi network. Then download the Phillips Hue App, go to the app settings and add your HomeBrige device. 

It will request that you click the bridge to activate the connection. 

After the HomeBridge is connected you can connect the lights by typing the six digit serial number on each light. 

At this step we recommend you group the lights into categories, which are called zones, in the app. This will make it easier to automate everything later on. 

You can also change the default light settings to have specific colors when people turn them on.
